# Your First Neural Network

In this project we build a simple neural network from the ground up to predict bikeshare usage for the month of December based on 60 days of historical data. The purpose of this project was to introduce neural networks and create a better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation and other concepts that might otherwise be hidden in higher level tools like Tensorflow.

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following python packages installed:

* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* jupyter notebook

## Instructions

In this directory run:

`jupyter notebook`
