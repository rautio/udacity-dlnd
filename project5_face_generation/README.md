# Image Classification

In this project we use a generative adverserial network (GAN) to genearte new images of faces that we've never seen based on the [CelebA dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html). We also train it on the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) for easier parameter tuning and model testing.
