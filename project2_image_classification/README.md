# Image Classification

In this project we build and train a convolutional neural network to classify images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) consisting of airplanes, dogs, cats and other objects. We use a convolutional layer, max pool layer and a fully connected layer with image normalization and one-hot encoding of the labels.
